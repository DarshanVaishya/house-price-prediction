	<p style="font-size:19px; padding-top:30px;">This project uses python programming language to get property listings from internet which is used to create a sophisticated machine learning model. This model trains itself with the thousands of property lisitings scraped to have accurate predictions. We have used python's scraping library beautiful soup(BS4) to scrape property lisings from <a href="https://www.makaan.com/ahmedabad-residential-property/buy-property-in-ahmedabad-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makaan.com</a>. This listings contain information such as number of rooms, square feet, area, price of the house. This parameters are fed into the linear regresion machine learning model.</p>

				<h6 class="display-6">1. Python</h6>
				<p class="pt-10">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>

				<h6 class="display-6">2. HTML, CSS</h6>
				<p class="pt-10">The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

				<h6 class="display-6">4. Flask</h6>
				<p class="pt-10">Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest and LinkedIn.</p>

				<h6 class="display-6">5. Machine learning</h6>
				<p class="pt-10">Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. </p>
